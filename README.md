MSP430POV
=========

Persistance of Vision using a TI MSP430 Microcontroller and Launchpad as programmer.

Single layer PCB intended to be etched at home (I need to test if it is possible to home etch using non photo resist methods given the widths of some of the tracks) with options for both surface mount and through hole components so the board can be used to teach soldering for either method.
